I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028

## Favorite CPSC120 Labs

Lab 3 
I liked lab 3, specifically both parts, because it gave me a better understanding of using doubles as well as formatting. It was a good way of learning how to input data. In regards to part 2, it was a nice and helpful introduction to inputting dates. Not only was I able to better understand the topics for the lesson, but I also made a friend meanwhile. Overall, Lab 3 was a fun experience. 

Lab 5
I enjoyed lab 5 due to it being pretty challenging. It was something I have never dealt with before considering we had to use for-loops to calculate the area of a triangle. My partner and I went over it together and were able to complete the lab. 

Lab 8, Part 2
I enjoyed lab 8, specifically part 2, the most out of all the labs. Although I have never played blackjack and did not know the rules prior to the lab I thought it was loads of fun. It helped me understand the rules of the game, but most importantly, helped me better understand booleans and what they could be used for.
